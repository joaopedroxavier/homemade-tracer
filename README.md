# Ray Tracing in One (or more) Weekend(s)
Studies and implementations from "Ray Tracing" series by Peter Shirley.

This is a series and compilation of my studies on the subject. What started on a simple "let me try to build something with this" is being more and more challenging with every feature I want to add on it.

Note: This is still under development. If you want to use the code, have fun with it, but I don't guarantee that it will work on your environment. 😁

## How to build
This project uses CMake for building. Make sure you have your CUDA toolkit installed and put your architecture on `CMakeLists.txt` file

## Keep checking in!
You can have a look under the [images](https://github.com/joaopedroxavier/homemade-tracer/tree/master/images) directory to check out some images I've created for testing.
